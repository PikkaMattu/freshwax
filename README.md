###Setup
- I would recommend using [laravel homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/homestead) to serve this 
- Install [composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- `cd laravel`
- `composer install`
- You're going to need to setup your `laravel/.env` to match your database setup visit laravel docs for more info
- `php artisan migrate:install`
- Let me know if you're stuck
